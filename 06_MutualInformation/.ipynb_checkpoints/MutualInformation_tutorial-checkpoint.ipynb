    "* js (jserences@ucsd.edu), Fall 2022 for NEUG-PSYC-231\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview:\n",
    "* In this tutorial, we will learn how to characterize the information that is shared between two variables (mutual information). In other words, how much is uncertainty reduced about variable 1 after we've measured variable 2? \n",
    "\n",
    "* These concepts were initially developed in communication theory to describe the efficacy of transmitting signals over a noisy medium. For example, suppose that we want to know how good a communication channel is, or its effeciency in reliably relaying a message from point A (a 'sender') to point B (a 'reciever').\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basically this is just like asking, \"we know how good the signal is at A, and we recieved the message at B - how much information about A is still in the received signal B?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutual information is also super relevant in many fields of neuroscience, psychology, engeneering, etc (and there are much fancier multivariate versions that we won't cover here). For example, in neuroscience we're dealing with a series of communication channels that are corrupted by noise (e.g. info relayed via synapses). We can then ask all kinds of questions like how much information from neuron A effectively propogates to neuron B? Or does attention orb learning increase the mutual information between neurons? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Importantly, we can apply these tools to any combination of variables: two continuous variables, two discrete variables, one continuous and one discrete, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: this also comes up in machine learning sometimes, where you can use mutual information to select the most informative features in a training data set (sklearn has some great tools for this)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A few notes before we get started. First, we're going to be talking a lot about **uncertainty** and **uncertainty reduction**. While this is basically complementary to talking about certainty and an increase in certainty, we'll deal with the former terminology as it is embedded in some of the concepts that we'll discuss. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, we'll be dealing with variability in data, and how we can either attribute that variability in the data to 'noise' or to 'signals'. I.e. does the variability in one variable systematically change with the variability in another? \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "A lot of people think, after first hearing about mutual information, \"why not just correlate the variables using a normal r-value?\". There are a few answers to this, but the simplest is this: correlation assumes a linear relationship (or, in more complex forms, you have to assume some relationship) between variables. Mutual information does not, and can generally capture any form of linear or non-linear relationship between two variables. This makes it a very powerful and general purpose metric.\n",

    "PART II: Entropy as a measure of variability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shannon Entropy is related to the variability of data, but is more specifically defined as the average uncertainty in a set of measurements \n",
    "* Consider coin tosses - lets say we have a balanced coin, and we flip it once. We can represent the outcome of a single toss as a 0 or a 1 (a head or a tail), and this has an entropy (uncertainty) of 1 bit. In other words, we would reduce our uncertainty completely after we observed the outcome, and that would correspond to a reduction in uncertainty of 1 bit. You could alternatively say that we learned 1 bit of information by making our measurement.  \n",
    "    * By extension, if we flipped the coin twice, then the entropy would be 2 bits (00, 01, 10, or 11) because we would reduce our uncertainty by 2 bits after we observed the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "* To keep with the coin analogy...when the coin is balanced and heads and tails are equally likely, then the entropy is highest because uncertainty is maximized and flipping the coin will give you 1 bit of information.  \n",
    "* To see why entropy is maximized in this situation, consider a biased coin  that comes up heads 60% the time. \n",
    "    * In this case, we could predict the outcome of the coin flip better than chance simply by going with our prior of 'heads'. Thus, the entropy assoicated with a biased coin is less than the entropy associated with the unbiased coin, because the reduction in uncertainty is lower with the biased coin than with the unbaised coin. \n",
    "    * Put another way: we learn less after flipping the biased coin than we do when we flip the unbiased coin. \n",
    "* This example brings up an important point: entropy as a measure of uncertainty is maximized when all possible outcomes are equally likely because you have no prior info upon which to make an educated guess about the outcome (i.e. a uniform distribution over the span of possible outcomes has the highest entropy).

    "* So the max value of MI is Hx...if knowing y is totally diagnostic of x, then the entropy of x given y (Hxy) will be 0, and MI will equal Hx.\n",
    "* So you can figure out Hx, and then go back to the simulation above and either increase the difference between the means (cond_means), or decrease the std (cond_std). In either case, you will reduce overlap between the conditions and knowing y will become more predictive of the value of x (i.e. if you measure y, you'll be able to better guess what condition that data came from). As you do this, MI should approach Hx...\n",
    "* Another intuition: the more overlap between the response distributions in each condition, the lower MI (because knowing y will give you ambiguous information about the value of x). However, as the overlap goes down, MI will go up, and when there is no overlap, the MI == Hx. "
